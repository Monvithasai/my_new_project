🌌 Project Title: “MemoryBridge AI – Reconstructing Lost Memories for Dementia Patients”

🧠 Concept
An AI system that reconstructs fragmented or lost memories for dementia patients using a combination of personal data, historical context, and generative storytelling—creating immersive memory experiences that feel familiar and emotionally resonant.

---

💡 What Makes It Unique?
Unlike existing memory aids or cognitive tools, MemoryBridge AI doesn’t just remind—it reimagines. It uses AI to generate *plausible reconstructions* of forgotten events, blending real data with creative inference to help patients reconnect with their identity and past.

🛠️ Core Features

- Memory Reconstruction Engine 
  Uses photos, voice recordings, social media, and family interviews to build a timeline of life events. Fills gaps with AI-generated narratives based on cultural, geographic, and temporal context.

- Emotionally Tuned Storytelling
  Applies sentiment analysis and emotional modeling to ensure reconstructed memories evoke comfort, joy, or familiarity—never confusion or distress.

- Sensory Playback Mode  
  Converts reconstructed memories into multi-sensory experiences: ambient sounds, visuals, and even simulated smells using smart home diffusers.

- Family Feedback Loop 
  Allows family members to review and refine AI-generated memories, ensuring accuracy and emotional safety.
